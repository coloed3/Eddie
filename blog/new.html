          <h3>  WHO the heck is Eddie?</h3>
          <div class="newarticle-p">
             <p> Eddie Colon , I am a father of two beautiful kids, a husband, youth pastor, a sinner saved by grace <span><-</span> for some this will be to much well move on! I have been doing front end web development consistenly for two years. I am a <strong>self taught .. </strong> web developer</p>
             <p>
               I Know I know its like a person buying a canon rebel taking pictures of there kids and calling themselves a professional photographer. You know and i know that we have all experienced that in our lives. I to started my professional photography career as a man wanting to capture moments of sunsets and there kids playing. I turned that joy into professional work. Click the camera <a href="http://www.eddiecolonphotography.com"><i class="fas fa-camera"></i></a>. Shameless plug i know! But back to the original thought

             </p>
             <div class="newarticle-subheader">
                <h3>So you wanna be a web developer?</h3>
             </div>
            <p> What does it take to become a web developer, what road did you take, was it hard, is it hard, did you doubt your self, did you quit or did you want to quit? These are all the questions i asked myself over and over again, at times it was super discouraging not getting a topic reading, re-watching videos. I had to sacrifice alot of time and sleep. When my friends were out I was coding, when my kids are watching tv I was coding.The question is do you want to be a web developer? If so, get ready for reality.</p>

            <p>
               Here is the reality, anyone can cook  -Ratatouille, joking side anyone can become a web developer. It takes a roadmap, a decision to become obessed or stay average. Well "Eddie it isnt that simple, I have no direction". Listen it is that simple  it is that easy it just takes a desire to set aside time every day  to improve your self. 33 years old , 2 college degrees and none of it has to do with web development or IT.
            </p>
            <p> I have an eye dieases, its hard for me to see, I cant see out of my left eye. Having this diease disqualified me from pursing Nursing. Whats this got to do with it? Well the above is a great excuse not to persue photography or wait how can you create pixel perfect designs if you cant see. <strong>BE phenomenal or be forgotten</strong> <em>-ET</em> lets drop the excuse and lets get on the path to becoming a web developer.</p>

            <div class="newarticle-subheader">
              <h3>Road Map</h3>
            </div>
            <p>There are so many good and bad resources for learning web development online. The one I suggest almost to everyone is the one Joe Santos Garcia created. If you dont know who Joe is  let me brief you. Joe is a teacher, Senior developer and a Content creator on Youtube and Founder/Owner of Codingphase. His style of teaching is easy to understand.  And you Build <strong>REAL</strong> projects. Projects that you can add to github and use in your portfolios. He is active on youtube and currently is doing a mentorship program where he takes 2 green developers and coaches, criqitues them and lays out the ground work on how to become a developer.<a href="http://codingphase.com/">Click HERE</a> </p>

            <p>
              On The road map, he breaks it down into 2 categories Front end or back end development. He goes through Every step, has videos  on both UDEMY and his site. Follow the time line.

              <Ul class="center-ui">
                <li>1. Create a schedule</li>
                <li>2. Stay motivated, Small wins</li>
                <li>3. When Watching or learning something new, Dont be that guy to burn through videos. Put it to work and learn the process. Dont move on until you grasp it. </li>
                <li>4. Build a project, your portfolio, sites for a friend get working on a project</li>
                <li>5. Sacrifice (time, going out)</li>
                <li>6. Invest in you. Buy courses and finish what you start </li>
                <li>7. DONT quit, there will times when you feel discouraged stay with it</li>

              </Ul>
            </p>

            <p>  Follow the road map, ever wonder why people use road maps? Cause the times prior to cell phones one false turn could lead you to a place you never been waisting time in the process. I have heard stories of new developers who start with a bootcamps online or following a road map through another company and they are learning and seeing it all come together. Than decide to take a course for 1200 bucks because its approved by google. Listen Stay on the road stay with the program your on, use codingphase or Udemy colte Steele bootcamp, Brad Traversy, TheNetNinja and finsh what you began</p>
